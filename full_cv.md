## Work history

### [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
**Product marketing manager in [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) team** (October, 2015 - March, 2022)

I joined JetBrains in 2015 as a Product Marketing Manager in [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) team. It was an interesting time when transition from Objective-C to Swift in iOS world had just started, and many challenges were faced. Some of major achievements during these 6 years: 

- We continued to evolve the product even in the situation when:
    - a completely new language (Swift) appeared, so we needed to implement its support from scratch
    - to support it we needed to implement its direct interop with Objective-C 
    - Swift itself evolved a lot and language changes were quite frequent. 
        
    The complexity and amount of work were close to creating the product from scratch again.

- I improved the first-time user experience as much as it was possible - starting from minor UX issues, migration from Xcode, "getting started" guides and up to implementing the [IDE Features Trainer plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8554-ide-features-trainer) part for iOS users and making important IDE features (building, testing, debuggin, code completion and navigation) available even before the indexing phase is finished. 

- I re-thought conference activities: made a formalized framework for choosing particular events important for the product, that allowed to track the communication with event organizers, past decisions about participation, and event planning. Usually, we participated in 8-10 events throughout the year and their preparation in this or that form was my responsibility.

- I continuously built a communication with big companies developing IDE tools and iOS/macOS applications and iOS community leaders.

- I drove several important integrations, product directions and features:
    - Swift Package Manager support
    - The whole direction of Swift on Linux ([from](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2015/12/swift-plugin-for-clion/) - [to](https://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2018/10/spm-support-clion/)), [Swift on Windows](https://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2021/03/swift-on-windows-in-clion/) and Swift on Server ([CLion](https://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2018/10/server-side-swift-clion-appcode/), [AppCode](https://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2021/03/server-side-swift-in-appcode/))
    - SourceKit integration (displaying errors/warnings/fix-its; completijn and navigation before the indexing is finished)
    - Database support in standard installers
    - [Code coverage](https://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2019/07/code-coverage/) support
    - Popular frameworks support (Quick/Nimble)
    - Run/build/debug/test without indexing

    We made the first and the best IDE for Swift on Linux and Windows in the form of the [Swift plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8240-swift) for [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

 - I created lots of release materials, tips, learning materials, and web help parts; covered important IDE areas with video materials (created mostly by myself maybe except the voice-over).

- I made the [G2HTML plugin](https://github.com/yeswolf/G2HTML) for converting Google Docs to clean HTML that allowed the marketing department to publish blog posts and other materials much faster.

- I drove several automatizations that allowed to reduce the amount of handwork during the IDE build publication.

- I created and improved the vision of [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17098-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-for-appcode) for AppCode; about 4 years from idea to product with several proof-of-concept solutions.

- I formalized the feature parity between AppCode and IDEA and made a lot to reduce the difference.

- I've made a framework for creating and reusing graphics materials for blog posts and social networks for myself.
