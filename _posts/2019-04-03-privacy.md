This is the Privacy Policy for the Apps Scripts I made available for use. One of such scripts is "Export to HTML" Google Docs plugin available [in the Google Workplace Marketplace](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/export_to_html/807648787184) ([source code](https://github.com/yeswolf/G2HTML))

This privacy policy sets out how the scripts use and protects any information that you supply when using them.

I'm committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. I ask for no information, nor is private information required to operate the scripts. This policy is effective from 03 Apr 2020.

The use of information received from Google APIs by any plugin mentioned here including but not limited to "Export to HTML" will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.

# <span style="color:red">**Yet another Big RED LINE - specially for Google reviewers**</span>

Probably, if you're a reviewer from Google, you cannot understand the word "nothing" and you search for the words "thoroughly disclose the manner in which your application accesses, uses, stores, or shares Google user data."
Look, now it's here. Here, especially for you, I _thoroughly_ describe: 

* "disclose the manner" - probably, you don't know, but each addon works solely with Google APIs. That's the manner it requests the information. If you don't know what the API is, RTFM. 
* "application accesses" - probably, it makes sense to repeat: each addon can access the user information solely using Google APIs. There is no other way to do that. That's what my addon does and that's how it accesses the information. 
* "uses" - go to "Permissions requested by specific plugin and their purpose" section on this page, open your eyes and read what's written here. But well, I do not believe that you will understand, so I will repeat once again. This plugin reads contents of the Google Document on your Google Drive, iterates through the Google Docs tree, converts it to HTML form. And that's the only way any user data is used, dot. No other way. 
* "stores" - I do not store any user data. No user data is stored. Nothing, no way. Never. 
* "shares" - I remember, that you don't understand the word "nothing", but please, do your best and understand, that this app *does not share any user data anywhere*. Never, nothing. Hope you got it.

## Security

I'm committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To this end, the scripts runs on the secure Google platform, specifically via the Apps Script services, and data is transferred via secure HTTP.

## Permissions requested by specific plugin and their purpose

### Export to HTML

- ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents``` - plugin reads the structure of Google Document and needs it for generating HTML, so it obviously needs ability to access the Google Document. 
- ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive``` and ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly``` - plugin needs to use ```DriveApp.getFilesByName``` [function](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/drive-app#getFilesByName(String)) to be able to save plugin settings to your Google Drive into ```g2html_settings.json``` file and rewrite old contents with new ones. These permissions are required by this API method from Google. 
- ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui``` - plugin has a user interface and this permission is required for showing it. 
- ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request``` - to simplify the code writing and making UI, plugin uses some JavaScript libraries (such as jQuery) and some external UI resources (like Font Awesome icons). This permission is required to load them from CDN (see the plugin code for details).
