This is the Privacy Policy for the Apps Scripts I made available for use. For example, one such script is [G2HTML](https://github.com/yeswolf/G2HTML).

This privacy policy sets out how the scripts use and protects any information that you supply when using them.

I'm committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. I ask for no information, nor is private information required to operate the scripts. This policy is effective from 03 Apr 2020.

## What I collect

Nothing.

## What I do with the information I gather

I do not gather or keep any information.

## Security

I'm committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To this end, the scripts runs on the secure Google platform, specifically via the Apps Script services, and data is transferred via secure HTTP.
