This is a short post about my main embedded side-project. 

## Overview

It's a musical pedal that transmits real-time audio over the air. The purpose is a flexible monitoring solution for professional musicians: sometimes you need to monitor a specific subset of band members during rehearsal, and it would be nice to have such ability without lots of wires. 

## Features

- Universal transceiver module and case design. Modules can be combined into a supermodule (stacked side to side using the 9-pin D-subs):

</a>
- Real-time low-latency audio, 32-bit 44100 Khz mono channel (stereo in the future).
- Full software control over the codec functions, analog mixing for modules connected:
    - EQ
    - Volume
    - Balance
    - Other functions
- DFU update over the USB.
- Desktop software for device management:

</a>
- Single encoder / push-button control over the OLED screen.
- Line / mic input, headphones (single output) / line out (single output)
- Inter-module communication: ability to have the first module connected to the laptop as a master module for controlling other modules (to easily change settings)

## Details of the prototype / schematics:

- STM32F103RCT6 as a core. 
- [AK4954AEN](https://www.akm.com/global/en/support/customer-care/eol/ak4954aen/) as a codec. Custom module board from the reference schematics:

</a>
- SSD1306 oled screen module
- Amicom [A7190](http://www.amiccom.com.tw/asp/product_detail.asp?CATG_ID=2&PRODUCT_ID=76) transceiver module as RF core for audio transmission. 
- 8k-bit EEPROM (from STM, random one)

Early version testing (first successfull full-speed audio transfer):

## Project architecture / parts

- DFU Bootloader ([standard one](https://yeswolf.github.io/dfu/))
- Firmware:
    - HAL part (generated via STM32Cube for faster prototyping)
    - FreeRTOS (because of queues and ability to structure the code properly)
    - C/C++ mix (generated sources in C, my code in C++)
    - RTT for debugging / logging
    - Drivers for peripherals (with abstract drivers for easier work with DMA / non-DMA transfers)
    - All peripherals configured with DMA (maximum speed)
    - Small custom UI framework (rendering based on the Adafruit Driver, to be changed in the future)
    - [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) tests with simple mocks for peripherals / interfaces:
