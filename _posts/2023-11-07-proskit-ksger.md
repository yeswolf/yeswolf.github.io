This is a post about tuning of KSGER T12 controller for using with SS-331 desoldering gun - WIP. 

## Problem

So-called "affordable" desoldering guns are good enough, SS-331 may be "rather cheap" or "rather expensive", but finally you want a compact unit with normal handle to make a desoldering. And better - with some good controller. Such options are expensive. 

## SS-331H handle

As of now, you [can buy](https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=lX5CUsZ) SS-331H handle separately. Though, there is not so much information about it from the first glance. So, pinout

- 1 - black - termoresistor ground
- 2 - blue - termoresistor signal
- 3 - red - heater ground
- 4 - red- heater vcc (24v)
- 5, 6 - pump button pins
- 7 - yellow - reed switch

Termoresistor is about 47 ohms (something like 47.8 ohms). I'm pretty sure it's different, so measure it by yourself. Heater resistance is about 2ohms and be sure it will be bigger (AFAIR up to 3.5 ohms) as soon as it starts heating. What does it mean for you - it means that in case of 24v you will need some power supply that works fine with 12A spikes. Or do as me - take 12v power supply that works with 8A and don't care about burning power outlets. Be sure - on start you will have a spike of 6A, but it fastly becames 4-3A after the initial heating. So, this "fast" would be enough to kill a wear supply. In short, take [this one](https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=qOXCUu8) and forget about all this problems. 

### Short note about termocouple vs termoresistor

Same as me, you may be not familiar with all these "whats the difference". So, termocouple generates small voltable - a bit of millivolts. Generates itself, without any power supply. Termoresistor generates nothing, it just changes it's resistance. Also its readings are more rough (usually). It means that any circuit working with a termocouple won't ever work with termoresistor - simply because it's part reading the voltage that indicates heating expects something without any voltage supplied to the sensor. In case of termoresistor you have a zero value always. To mimic a termocouple behavitor with a termoresistor, you should do the following:

- Measure it's resistance with 25 degrees of celcius
- Supply some voltage via some addon to the circuit
- Susbstract from this voltage the voltage generated byt the initial termoresistor state
- Divide or multiply to mimic the termocouple target voltage

Sounds complex, but in fact a single opamp is needed. 

## KSGER 2.1s module

Lots of people talk about different layouts, but the reality is that for now you'll find the only one [official one](https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=T39fUG8). It doesn't have any zero ohm resistor or special place to support JBL. So, you will need to perform the following changes:
