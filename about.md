Mobile developer (Windows Mobile 2003-5.x-6.x, Blackberry 4.3-7.x, Android 2.3-4.x, iOS 2.x-until now), project and product manager in mobile teams, finally AppCode product marketing manager. Embedded enthusiast (latest achievement - soldering LQFP-100). Slap bass player. Can fix anything. 

Projects / contributions / unsorted:

- Evernote for Blackberry ([dead](https://evernote.com/blog/support-for-blackberry-and-windows-phone-end/)). It was a great time. From the website wrapper to the native app. I should write a story about it. 
- EverN9 for Meego (reused in [Bluewhale](https://github.com/locusf/bluewhale)). And yes, I have a working N950 phone :)
- [Semantic highlighting for Swift](https://blog.jetbrains.com/appcode/2016/11/appcode-2016-3-eap-resolve/)
- [SwiftLint plugin](https://github.com/bealex/SwiftLintAppCode)
- Re-worked AppCode colors schemes and Xcode keymap / behavior part
- Support for San Francisco fonts in JB JDK
- AppCode ([dead](https://blog.jetbrains.com/appcode/2022/12/appcode-2022-3-release-and-end-of-sales-and-support/). It was a dream job. Deserves a book, really.

My CVs if you don't have time:

- Short [EN](/cv_short/)

I'm not open to any job offers outside Russia, Saint-Petersburg. Now working in Huawei.
